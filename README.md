# Chorme-SF-SocialChecker
Chorme plugin to check from comfort of Social sites if the Social account is present in Salesforce or not.

So you are using Salesforce and Linkedin to manage you Contacts and Leads.!!

Here is one great plugin to check if a certain LinkedIn profile is already present in your connected Salesforce org or not.

On your browser you do not need to be always logged in log in to get results. Features - 
1. Connect once and forget, connect using the plugin and authorize.
2. Go to any LinkedIn profile page and you will be able to view how many matching Contacts or Leads are already present in connected org.
3. Displays top 2 results and can directly jump to the record detail page from LinkedIn user detail page
4. If there are more results, click on the plugin icon and directly get all results related to the LinkedIn user
5. No extra package needed to be installed on org so less maintenance and simplistic approach

There are lots of future scope planned for this plugin like - 
1. Connect with Gmail and Facebook
2. Give greater insights
3. Directly create new Leads / Contacts from the plugin itself

The cost of this plugin has been kept minimum so that maximum users can install and use it. Also honestly this will give motivation to developers as well to keep releasing new features at same price always.
